### 4.5 Local Stellar Scale: Gaia DR3 Precision
Validation using **Gaia Mission** astrometry. 
* **Stellar Drift:** The "anomalous" velocities in stellar streams are not caused by sub-halos of dark matter, but by the **Quaternionic Drift** ($q_z$) induced by the vacuum's tortuosity ($\tau = 2.221$).
* **Local Coherence:** Within the solar neighborhood, the metric remains close to the $0.921$ trunk, ensuring the stability of planetary orbits while allowing for the observed galactic rotation curve boost.
