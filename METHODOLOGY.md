# 🛡️ Methodology: Quaternionic Dimensional Reduction Law (MFSU V2.2)

## 1. Overview
This methodology formalizes the **Unified Stochastic Fractal Model (MFSU)**. It reinterprets gravitational anomalies—from wave signal decay to galactic rotation curves—not as missing mass, but as a loss of topological coherence in a fractal vacuum. 

We transition from a linear decay to a **Quantum Branching Logic**, where spacetime acts as a self-similar dissipative fractal medium governed by a **Quaternionic Phase Shift**.

## 2. Fundamental Constants
The model is anchored by four universal geometric invariants:

* **Ancestral Seed ($\delta_F = 0.921$):** The original topological deficit. A value of $0.921$ indicates an **Original Event (Trunk)**. Small variations indicate **Branch Events** or younger structures.
* **Impedance Factor ($\chi = 5.85$):** The geometric constant regulating gravitational and electromagnetic flux in the porous vacuum.
* **Tortuosity ($\tau = 2.221$):** The path complexity factor within the fractal dimension $D_f = 2.079$.
* **Branching Constant ($R_f = 5.03 \times 10^{-5}$):** The rate of dimensional loss per level ($n$).

## 3. The Law of Dimensional Reduction (Franco's Law)
The effective coherence at any point in the fractal tree is given by:

$$\delta_F(n) = 0.921 \cdot (1 - R_f)^n$$

To resolve Euclidean singularities and model orientation, we apply a **Quaternionic Rotation Operator ($q$)**:
$$q = \cos(\theta/2) + \mathbf{u} \sin(\theta/2)$$
Where $\theta = \arccos(\delta_F)$ represents the phase shift of the metric.

## 4. Multi-Scale Empirical Validation

### 4.1 Gravitational Waves (LIGO)
Analysis of 92 events confirms that signals decay according to their branching level $n$. Trunk events ($n=0$) maintain the $0.921$ signature.

### 4.2 Galactic Dynamics (SPARC & GAIA)
The "Dark Matter" effect is corrected by the **Impedance Factor**:
$$V_{obs} = V_{newton} \cdot \chi^{(1 - q_w)}$$
This explains the flat rotation curves in 175 galaxies (SPARC) and the stellar boost in our neighborhood (GAIA).

### 4.3 High-Energy Phase (IXPE & FERMI)
* **IXPE:** Polarization is modeled as the rotation of the $q_z$ component of the metric.
* **FERMI:** Gamma-ray attenuation follows the geometric dissipation of the fractal network.

### 4.4 Primitive Cosmology (JWST)
The "Impossible Galaxies" at high redshift ($z>10$) are resolved by the amplification factor of $\chi$ as the light travels through thousands of fractal generations ($n$).
