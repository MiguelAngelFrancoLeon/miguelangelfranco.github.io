# Methodology: Fractal Chronology of Gravitational Events (MFSU)

## 1. Overview
This methodology describes the application of the **Unified Stochastic Fractal Model (MFSU)** to the gravitational wave events detected by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaboration. Unlike standard General Relativity, this model interprets the variation in signal coherence as a function of its **Fractal Age**.

## 2. Fundamental Constants
The model is anchored by two critical values derived from the Infinite Fractal Cubes Theory (IFCT):
* **Seed Constant ($\delta_F = 0.921$):** Represents the "Original Event" or "Spacetime Root." It is the state of maximum coherence and original symmetry.
* **Branch Constant ($\delta_F = 0.918$):** Represents the "Young Branch" or "Maximum Entropy Point." It is the limit of signal dispersion after traveling through the fractal medium.

## 3. The Distance-Decay Law (Franco's Law)
The core premise is that **Spacetime is a dissipative fractal medium**. As a gravitational wave propagates, it undergoes "branching" (ramificación). The further the distance ($D$), the lower the fractal dimension ($\delta_F$) of the received signal.

### 3.1 Mathematical Calculation
The fractal value is determined by:
$$\delta_F = \text{max} \left( 0.918, 0.921 - \left( \frac{D_{Mpc}}{10,000} \cdot 0.003 \right) \right)$$

* **Exception for Baryonic Coherence:** Events involving Neutron Stars (NS) or events located within the local neighborhood (< 150 Mpc) bypass this decay, as the high density of matter "anchors" the fractal structure to its seed value of **0.921**.

## 4. Classification Hierarchy
Events are categorized into three lineages based on their calculated $\delta_F$:
1.  **Original Seed (0.921):** Ancestral events (e.g., GW200220, GW170817).
2.  **Mature Branch (0.920 - 0.919):** Primary evolutions of the spacetime fabric.
3.  **Young Branch (0.918):** Distant or highly entropy-driven events near the limit of the current expansion cycle.

## 5. Cosmic Cycle Implication
This methodology supports the **Cyclic Universe Theory**, where black holes act as extrusion nozzles. A seed event at 0.921 marks the birth of a local cycle, while the decay towards 0.918 marks its expansion and eventual ramification into new sub-structures.
