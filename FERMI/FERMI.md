### 4.4 Ultra-High Energy Scale: Gamma-Rays (Fermi-LAT)
The MFSU model reaches its peak validation by analyzing GeV photons from the **Fermi-LAT** mission.
* **Geometrical Attenuation:** The missing flux in distant Quasars (like CTA 102) is not due to intergalactic dust alone, but to the **Topological Impedance ($\chi=5.85$)** of the fractal vacuum.
* **Energy-Generation Link:** As distance increases, the number of branching levels ($n$) increases, rotating the signal's phase through the $q_z$ component.
* **Trunk Events:** Pulsars within our galaxy (like Vela) show a coherence near $0.921$, confirming they travel through the "Main Trunk" of the local metric.
