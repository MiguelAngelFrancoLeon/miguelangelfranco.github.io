### 4.3 High-Energy Scale: X-Ray Polarimetry (IXPE)
The model extends to the polarimetric data from the **IXPE Mission**. 
* **Polarization Degree (PD):** Instead of purely magnetic synchrotron emission, the MFSU models PD as the residual topological coherence of the vacuum.
* **Phase Rotation:** The Polarization Angle (PA) is mapped as a rotation in the $q_z$ imaginary plane of the quaternion, where the impedance $\chi=5.85$ acts as a filter for photon orientation.
* **Result:** Sources like the Crab Nebula show a quaternionic stability consistent with the $0.921$ seed, proving that even at X-ray frequencies, the fractal metric governs the flow of light.
---# 🛰️ IXPE Validation: X-Ray Quaternionic Polarimetry

## Overview
Validation of the MFSU model using high-energy polarimetry data from the **IXPE (Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer)** mission. This dataset proves that the polarization of photons is governed by the quaternionic rotation of the vacuum metric.

## Key Findings
* **Cyg X-1 Coherence:** High topological stability (0.98), indicating a direct link to the primordial trunk ($0.921$).
* **Supernova Remnants (Cas A, MSH 15-52):** Significant phase rotation ($q_z$) due to fractal branching in expanding plasma clouds.
* **Impedance Scaling:** The polarization degree (PD) follows the impedance law $\chi = 5.85$, acting as a geometric filter.

## Data Structure
- `Source`: Astronomical object observed by IXPE.
- `MFSU_Quat_W`: Real part of the quaternion (Topological Coherence).
- `MFSU_Quat_Z`: Imaginary part (Phase Rotation/Polarization Angle).
- `Topological_Coherence`: Ratio of preserved information relative to the seed $0.921$.
