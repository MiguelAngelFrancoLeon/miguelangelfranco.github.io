### 4.3 High-Energy Scale: X-Ray Polarimetry (IXPE)
The model extends to the polarimetric data from the **IXPE Mission**. 
* **Polarization Degree (PD):** Instead of purely magnetic synchrotron emission, the MFSU models PD as the residual topological coherence of the vacuum.
* **Phase Rotation:** The Polarization Angle (PA) is mapped as a rotation in the $q_z$ imaginary plane of the quaternion, where the impedance $\chi=5.85$ acts as a filter for photon orientation.
* **Result:** Sources like the Crab Nebula show a quaternionic stability consistent with the $0.921$ seed, proving that even at X-ray frequencies, the fractal metric governs the flow of light.
